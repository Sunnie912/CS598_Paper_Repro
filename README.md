# Reproducibility of Clinical Presence Fairness

This repository allows to reproduce results from the paper [Imputation Strategies Under Clinical Presence: Impact on Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06648). This paper explores the importance of imputation on algorithmic fairness. 2 folders in this repository allow for the reproducibility of the paper's result:

>ðŸ“‹  Synthetic: This folder contains 2 files: `utils.py` and `synthetic.ipynb`. \
`utils.py` contains all the functions.\
`synthetic.ipynb` contains methods to create synthetic sample results by enforcing the **clinical presence** patterns identified in the paper. The following figure introduces the 3 different scenarios of clinical presence, i.e. the complex interaction between patients and healthcare, that can result in group-specific missingness patterns.

Since we will be using the MIMIC-III dataset, it is not necessary to run `synthetic.ipynb`.

>ðŸ“‹  Mimic: This folder contains 3 notebooks: `preprocessing.ipynb` to extract the labratory tests and the study population, `experiment.ipynb` to run the different imputation pipelines, and `analysis_group.ipynb` to compare the pipeline performances.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

To conduct the data cleaning, run through notebook `preprocessing.ipynb`. Change the `path` in the first cell to your local path of the MIMIC-III dataset. This notebook save the cleaned data to the `mimic/data` folder. \

Then to train the model(s) in the paper and get imputation results, run through notebook `mimic/experiment.ipynb`. To get the same result, use the provided seed `1234`. This notebook uses the cleaned data from the first step in the `mimic/data` folder, and saves the computation results to the `mimic/result` folder.


## Evaluation

To evaluate the imputation results from last step, run through notebook `mimic/eanalysis groups.ipynb`. This notebook analyzes the results from the `mimic/result` folder.


## Results

Our model reproduced the prioritisation rates and false negative rates reported in the paper and graphed their equal performance measures.\
